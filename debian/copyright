 In the preparation of the 0.8.90 release Novell took care of tracking
 down all the contributors to get them to relicense their artwork
 into Public Domain.
 .
 The COPYING file of the tarball states the following:
 The icons in this repository are herefore released into the Public Domain.
 .
 Additionally the copyright status of the files was tracked in the CVS and the
 rdf properties of the SVGs adjusted for all files that were put into Public
 Domain (see rdf:about and rdf:resource).  Both fields contain a link to the
 Creative Commons Public Domain Dediciation[0] as reproduced below:
 Public Domain Dedication
 .
 Copyright-Only Dedication (based on United States law) or Public Domain
 Certification
 .
 The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the
 "Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the best
 of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public
 domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b)
 hereby dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work
 of authorship identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A
 certifier, moreover, dedicates any copyright interest he may have in
 the associated work, and for these purposes, is described as a
 "dedicator" below.
 .
 A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright
 status of this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts
 may not shield him from liability if in fact the work certified is not
 in the public domain.
 .
 Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at
 large and to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors.
 Dedicator intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment
 in perpetuity of all present and future rights under copyright law,
 whether vested or contingent, in the Work. Dedicator understands that
 such relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all
 rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the
 Work.
 .
 Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work
 may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified,
 built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial
 or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods that have not
 yet been invented or conceived.
